# **Perceptron**

This code demonstrates how to use a single layer Perceptron model to classify the MNIST dataset. Single layer Perceptrons are a type of linear classifier that can be used to separate data into two categories. The code also includes visualization of the confusion matrices for each class.

**Dependencies**

- numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- tensorflow
- keras

**Usage**

1. Load the necessary libraries and set the random number generator seed.
2. Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
3. Train a Perceptron model for each class in the dataset.
4. Visualize the confusion matrices for each class.
