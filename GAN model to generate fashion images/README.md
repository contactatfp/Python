# **GANs for Fashion Images**

This project focuses on using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate fashion images. The project uses the Fashion MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 10 different classes of fashion items. The project follows the steps outlined in the Kaggle notebook [Introduction to GANs on Fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sayakdasgupta/introduction-to-gans-on-fashion-mnist-dataset#Simple-GAN-Model).

**Dependencies**

This project requires the following libraries:

- numpy
- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- pydot
- imgaug

**Files**

The project consists of a single Jupyter notebook, **GAN Model.ipynb** , which contains the code for loading and preprocessing the data, building and training the GAN model, and generating and visualizing the generated fashion images.

**Usage**

To run the project, open the Jupyter notebook and follow the instructions in the cells. Make sure to install any necessary dependencies and have the required data files in the correct directories.
