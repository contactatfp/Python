**Introduction**

This code is a machine learning model for recognizing flowers using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Keras. It is trained on a dataset of flower images and can classify them into five different categories: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip.

**Dependencies**

To run this code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- tensorflow
- keras
- matplotlib
- pydot
- skimage

You can install these libraries using **pip** by running the following command:

Copy code

pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib pydot skimage

**Data**

The data for this model is a collection of flower images that have been divided into training and testing sets. The training set consists of 3456 images, and the testing set consists of 861 images. The images are 180x180 pixels in size and are in JPEG format.

**Model**

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in Keras. It consists of several convolutional and max pooling layers, followed by a fully connected layer with a softmax activation function. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss.

**Usage**

To use this model, you will need to first extract the data from the **homework8\_input\_data.zip** file and place it in the correct directory. Then, you can run the code to train and evaluate the model.

**Evaluation**

The model is evaluated using a validation set, which is a subset of the testing data. The evaluation metric used is accuracy, which is the percentage of correctly classified images.
